# When Virtual Reality hits you!

It was dark and loud...I could hear noises.."Hands in the Air". When I opened my eyes, I was lying half conscious in the middle of the road surrounded by cops. I wore a white Bengali saree covered with dust. I couldn't remember who I was and what was I doing out there. Two cops came forward, arrested me and put me in the prison.<br><br>
Next day, a young girl named Su came to visit me with a painting. The portrait was mine. She drew it. She told me how she lived alone in a big house. After 2 days, the cops released me on bail; but their eyes followed me everywhere I went. There were cops everywhere, on the sidewalk, in restraurants, felt like it was a Cop Town. <br><br>
While I was walking, a guy bumped into me. He sort of recognized me. Didnt clearly say who I was but claimed to be my boyfriend. I had no idea. He gave me a corn and said throw it when you're in trouble. The next thing I remember is I was standing in a jeep with my hands cuffed. The road was crowded. It was like a procession of me on the road. I was in trouble. So I threw the corn up in the air and the corn kernels turned into big popcorns and started showering on us. Everyone got out of the jeep and left me to drown. It went dark again...<br><br>When I woke up I was sitting in a trunk of a car. I went pale when I saw my so-called boyfriends's head was hanging on the mirror emitting blue light from beneath. Suddenly a memory flashed in front of my eyes. That's when I remembered I was playing a game in Virtual Reality. I said I lost my Voice Assistant guiding me through the game, hence I was stuck. And the "boyfriend" was actually a Robot.
